## Branching Strategy

The GitHub flow branching strategy / workflow will be utilized for the projects. Three types of branches will be used. These are:

- Main: production or submission ready work / code
- Feature: in-progress work adding new features
- Hotfix: small bug fixes / changes to features or production files

The workflow will follow the following steps:
- Create a new Branch
- Make changes and add Commits
- Open a Pull Request
- Review
- Deploy
- Merge

## .gitignore

The .gitignore files will contain the following items:

- Project 1: no .gitignore
- Project 2: .gitignore template for visual studio and credential files
- Project 3: Uknown at this time
- Project 5: Uknown at this time
- Project 5: Uknown at this time

## Storage of Credentials

Credentials for projects will be stored locally on developer machines. They will be excluded from Git commits through use of .gitignore files to ensure security.
